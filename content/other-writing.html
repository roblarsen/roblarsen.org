<p>I wrote about cinema for several years for <a href="http://www.weeklydig.com/">Boston's Weekly Dig</a> (where I also served as Film Editor), Shovel Magazine and The Boston Metro. My <a href="http://www.drunkenfist.com/movies.php">movies</a> archive contains my (almost) complete film writing archive. I was fortunate to interview some very cool people, including Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, and Darren Aronofsky</p>
<p>When I was younger I also co-wrote and co-produced a play called <em>Black Cats and White Lies</em> that played at the <a href="http://www.cas.suffolk.edu/theatre/">C. Walsh Theater</a> at Suffolk University. <br>
</p>
<p> I also wrote a <a href="http://comics.drunkenfist.com/collecting-superhero-comic-books/">cover article about collectible comics</a> for <a href="http://www.rarebookreview.com/">Rare Book Review</a>.</p>
