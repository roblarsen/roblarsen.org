<h2>Art</h2>
    <p>The path to this point in my creative life is surprisingly  direct. Bits grow on top of bits and styles evolve, but everything I am now as  an artist can be accurately traced back to the kid who�d been a regular at the  MFA since before he could walk, started drawing as soon as he could hold a  pencil and immersed himself in the energy and urban chaos of graffiti in the  1980s. Currently all of that stuff (and the intervening 25+ years) is funneled  into work that tries to distill the energy of the city and the freestyle  typography of graffiti onto canvas. My process tries to replicate the layering  of city walls and the random, energetic way that the environment and man  conspire to transform the city�s surfaces.</p>
    <p> I've shown my art regularly over the past several years. I've been fortunate to have my art hang alongside artists like Seen, Cope2, Blade, T-Kid, Rickey Powell, Sever, Tracy 168, Ces, Med, Sever, Kem5, Alert, Vault, Alone, Percy Fortini Wright, Sly and Rath. Here's a full list of shows I've taken part in:</p>

    <p>I've been interviewed dozens of times for everything from school papers to web sites, books and newspapers about the subject of graffiti art. My comments on the subject have appeared in several places including the the <a href="http://www.weeklydig.com/">Weekly Dig, </a>local arts website <a href="http://www.bigredandshiny.com/cgi-bin/retrieve.pl">Big, Red and Shiny</a> and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061698784/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=drunkenfistcom&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0061698784">The History of American Graffiti</a>.</p>
    <p>I've also done some illustration, both black and white and color, for several local publications; most notably a cover for the <a href="/art/graffiti-art/digital/bostons-weekly-dig-cover.php">Weekly Dig's graffiti issue.</a>
