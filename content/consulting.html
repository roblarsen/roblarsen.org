I've spent the majority of the past decade working as a consultant and agency guy. At firms both large (10,000+) and small (3) I've worked with some of the biggest companies in the world on a wide range of projects. I've worked on humble one page to multi-million dollar CMS implementations and everything in between. Along the way I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two about a thing or two. 

I'm now working independently, hoping to provide the same high level of expertise and knowledge directly to a small number of clients.

So how can I help you? Here are some of the many ways I can help you: 

<dl>
<dt>Front end architecture</dt>
<dd><p>I've done more of this than most people. Working where I've worked I've been challenged to craft front end solutions that work seamlessly with multiple platforms and multiple environments. I have my personal preferences, of course, but they're never unchallenged since clients and my peers also have their own preferences and requirements. Since I'm constantly evaluating my choices the expertise I offer is far more than a "top 40" collection of the trendiest front end tools. I'm ready to help you with the solution that's best for your business, platform and team.</p>
<p>Sometimes you really do need to reinvent the wheel. Other times it's best to leave well enough alone. I know the difference. </p>
<p>In specific, I can help with anything from a gut-check on your existing architectural direction to the development of a full-blown proof of concept ready to use as the foundation for your own development. </dd>
<dt>Training</dt>
<dd><p>I offer HMTL, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery training for beginner/intermediate front end developers. Based on my book, Beginning HMTL and CSS, this training will five you a solid foundation in the building blocks of front end web development. I can tailor this by topic and by timeframe based on your needs.</dd>
<dt>Front end development and technology consulting</dt>
<dd><p>I've built a lot of web sites and applications. I can build <strong>your</strong> site or application. I'm particularly interested in helping out with the following kinds of problems:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>AngularJS applications and components</li>
<li>Responsive web design</li>
<li>Mobile web</li>
<li>Custom wordpress themes</li>
<li>Web performance consulting</li>
</ul>
</dd>
