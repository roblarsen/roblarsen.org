 <blockquote>My life changed in a fundamental way in 1984 when I was fortunate enough to see the Style Wars documentary on PBS. Before the show was even over I was messing around with with letters and I haven't stopped since. The approach shifts and the focus changes but to this day I'm still trying to capture, on walls, canvas and paper the same incredible energy that played out across the subways of New York all those years ago. </p>
