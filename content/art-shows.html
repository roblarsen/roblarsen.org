<p>I've shown my art regularly over the past decade. I've been fortunate to have my art hang alongside artists like Seen, Cope2, Blade, T-Kid, Rickey Powell, Sever, Tracy 168, Ces, Med, Sever, Kem5, Alert, Vault, Alone, Percy Fortini Wright, Sly and Rath. All you can do when you've got folks like that hanging next to you is hope you don't embarrass yourself. </p>
