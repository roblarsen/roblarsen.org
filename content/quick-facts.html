<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Rob Larsen.</strong> I'm an artist, professional author, and web technologist from Boston.</p>
<p>Here are six quick facts that might give a sense of who I am:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I'm a technology executive in the financial services industry. I've built large, global engineering teams from the ground up and have mentored dozens of accomplished front-end engineers and technologists. </li>
  <li>I'm a published writer with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Rob-Larsen/author/B007EC5FL6">five books</a> and freelance credits as diverse as IBM developerWorks, Dig Boston, Amazon's technology blog,  the Boston Metro and Rare Book Review. I've interviewed people like Bernie Wrightson, <a href="http://www.drunkenfist.com/movies/hollywood/jackie-chan-the-tuxedo.php">Jackie Chan</a>, Tony Hawk, Donnie Yen and <a href="http://www.drunkenfist.com/movies/hollywood/requiem-for-a-dream.php">Darren Aronofsky</a>.</li>
  <li>I've been doing graffiti and graffiti style art since 1984. I paint around the Northeast regularly with the BLT and IMOK crews and have an active studio practice.</li>
  <li>I'm an expert on collectible comic books, with a strong focus on the rarest, most valuable books in the hobby.</li>
  <li>I'm available for quotes, articles, teaching and speaking on any of these subjects. If you're looking for someone to talk to or write about any of this stuff, <a href="mailto:rob@drunkenfist.com">I'm your man.</a></li>
  <li>I'm President of the board of the <a href="https://brattlefilm.org/about/the-brattle-film-foundation/">Brattle Film Foundation</a> and a Corporate Trustee and member of the Advisory Council of <a href="https://thetrustees.org/">The Trustees.</a></li>
</ol>
