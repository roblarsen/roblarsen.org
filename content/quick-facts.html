<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Rob Larsen.</strong> I'm a graffiti artist, professional author, speaker and web technologist from Boston.</p>
<p>Here are five quick facts that might give a sense of who I am:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I've been doing graffiti and graffiti style art since 1984. My art is in collections all around the country and is regularly shown alongside some of the biggest names in graffiti and street art.</li>
  <li>I'm an expert front end engineer with a resume that stretches back to the 1990s. I've built over 100 web sites and am experienced making complicated, cutting edge web applications. I'm also an experienced team lead and have built large, global engineering teams from the ground up. </li>
  <li>I'm a published writer with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rob-Larsen/e/B007EC5FL6/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=drunkenfistcom">three books</a> and freelance credits as diverse as IBM developerWorks, The Weekly Dig, the Boston Metro and Rare Book Review.

  <li>I'm an expert on collectible comic books, with a strong focus on the rarest, most valuable books in the hobby.</li>
  <li>I'm available for quotes, articles, teaching and speaking on any of these subjects. I regularly present on web technology and I've taught classes on graffiti to students from middle school through college. If you're looking for someone to talk to or write about any of those subjects, <a href="mailt:rob@drunkenfist.com">I'm your man.</a></li>
